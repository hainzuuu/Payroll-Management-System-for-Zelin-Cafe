# Payroll Management System

## Overview
This Payroll Management System was developed as a project during my second year of college for the subject Application Development and Emerging Technologies in IT. Built using C# and Visual Studio, the system provides an efficient way to track employee work hours and manage payroll calculations. It features two interfaces: one for employees and another for administrators.

## Features

### Employee Interface
- View time-in and time-out history
- Export attendance history to Excel
- Automatic calculation of earnings based on hourly rate
- Request edits to time-in and time-out records (pending admin approval)

### Admin Interface
- Create and manage employee accounts
- View employee attendance history
- Receive notifications for late time-ins or late time-outs
- Edit employee time-in and time-out records with employee authorization
- Modify hourly pay rate
- Add or deduct contributions such as tax, SSS, and PhilHealth

## About the Project  
This Mini Coffee Shop Ordering System was developed during my second year of college for the subject *Computer Programming 3* using C# and Windows Forms. The project simulates a real-world ordering system, allowing users to add items to their cart, adjust quantities, and see real-time billing updates before confirming their order.

# Payroll Management System

## Overview
This Payroll Management System was developed as a project during my second year of college in IT. It is built using C# and Visual Studio, providing an efficient way to track employee work hours and manage payroll calculations. The system features two interfaces: one for employees and another for administrators.

## Features

### Employee Interface
- View time-in and time-out history
- Export attendance history to Excel
- Automatic calculation of earnings based on hourly rate
- Request edits to time-in and time-out records (pending admin approval)

### Admin Interface
- Create and manage employee accounts
- View employee attendance history
- Receive notifications for late time-ins or late time-outs
- Edit employee time-in and time-out records with employee authorization
- Modify hourly pay rate
- Add or deduct contributions such as tax, SSS, and PhilHealth

### About the Project

This Payroll Management System was developed during my second year of college for the subject Application Development and Emerging Technologies. The project was designed to provide an efficient way to track employee work hours and manage payroll calculations.
